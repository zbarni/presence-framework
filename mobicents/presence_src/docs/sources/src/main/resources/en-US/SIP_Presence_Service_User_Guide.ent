<!-- NOTES ON CHANGING ENTITY FILES
Important: take care when changing entities for directories
* Linux path separators must be: "/"
* Windows path separators must be: "\"
* Entities which represent directories MUST HAVE a final path separator:
	my/path/  <- (final separator)
If this final separator is missing, then the documentation will be wrong. -->
