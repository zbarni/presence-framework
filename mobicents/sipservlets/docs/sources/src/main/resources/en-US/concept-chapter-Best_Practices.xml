      <para>To ensure the server is finely tuned for a production envirionment, certain configuration must be changed. Visit the <ulink url="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JBossASTuningSliming">JBoss Application Server Tuning</ulink> wiki page to learn about optimization techniques.
       </para>
      <para>While it is preferable to have a fast Application Server, most of the information doesn&apos;t apply to &PLATFORM_NAME;. In summary, the most important optimization technique is to remove logs, leaving only what is required.</para>

      <title>Tuning The JAIN SIP Stack</title>
      <para>The stack can be fine-tuned by altering the SIP stack properties, defined in the external properties file specified by the <emphasis>sipStackPropertiesFile</emphasis> attribute as described in <xref linkend="bsssc-binary-SIP_Servlets_Server-Adding_SIP_Connectors"/>.</para>

          <para>This thread pool is
          responsible for parsing SIP messages received from socket messages into
          objects.</para>
          <para>A smaller value will make the stack less responsive, since
          new messages have to wait in a queue for free threads. In UDP, this

          <para><emphasis>Default value: 65536</emphasis>. </para>
          <para>Those properties control the size of the UDP buffer used for SIP messages. Under load, if the buffer capacity is overflown the messages are dropped causing retransmissions, further increasing the load and causing even more retransmissions.</para>

          <para><emphasis>Default value: 10000</emphasis>. </para>
          <para>This property controls the maximum size of content that can be read for a SIP Message on UDP.  The default is 65536. The average UDP message size is quite lower than this so reducing this property will benefit memory usage since a byte buffer of this size is created for every message received.</para> 
          <para>It also defines the maximum size of content that a TCP connection can read. Must be at least 4K. Default is "infinity" -- ie. no limit. This is to prevent DOS attacks launched by writing to a TCP connection until the server chokes.</para>

          <para><emphasis>Default value: 30</emphasis>. </para>
          <para>Use 0 or do not set this option to disable it. When using TCP, your phones/clients usually connect independently, creating their own TCP sockets. Sometimes however SIP devices are allowed to tunnel multiple calls over a single socket. This can also be simulated with SIPP by running "sipp -t t1".</para>
          <para>In the stack, each TCP socket has it's own thread. When all calls are using the same socket they all use a single thread, which leads to severe performance penalty, especially on multi-core machines. This option instructs the SIP stack to use a thread pool and split the CPU load between many threads. The number of the threads is specified in this parameter.</para>
          <para>The processing is split immediately after the parsing of the message. It cannot be split before the parsing because in TCP the SIP message size is in the Content-Length header of the message and the access to the TCP network stream has to be synchronized.</para>
          <para>Additionally, in TCP the message size can be larger. This causes most of the parsing for all calls to occur in a single thread, which may have impact on the performance in trivial applications using a single socket for all calls. In most applications it doesn't have performance impact. If the phones/clients use separate TCP sockets for each call, this option doesn't have much impact, except the slightly increased memory footprint caused by the thread pool. It is recommended to disable this option in this case by setting it 0 or not setting it at all. You can simulate multi-socket mode with "sipp -t t0". With this option also we avoid closing the TCP socket when something fails, because we must keep processing other messages for other calls. Note: This option relies on accurate Content-Length headers in the SIP messages. It cannot recover once a malformed message is processed, because the stream iterator will not be aligned any more. Eventually the connection will be closed.</para>

          ergonomics automatically attempt to select the best garbage collector. The
          default behaviour is to select the throughput collector, however a disadvantage of the throughput collector is that it can have long pauses times, which
          ultimately blocks JVM processing. </para>
          <para>For low-load implementations, consider using the incremental, low-pause, garbage collector
          (activated by specifying <emphasis>
              <userinput>-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode</userinput>

  <section id="bp-Best_Practices_NAT">
    <title>NAT Traversal</title>
    <para>In a production environment, it is common to see SIP and Media
    data passing through different kinds of Network Address Translation (NAT) to reach the
    required endpoints. Because NAT Traversal is a complex topic, refer to the following information to help determine the most effective method to handle NAT issues.</para>
    <section>
      <title>STUN</title>
      <para>STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) is not generally
      considered a viable solution for enterprises because STUN cannot be used
      with symmetric NATs.</para>
      <para>Most enterprise-grade
      firewalls are symmetric, therefore STUN support must be provided in the SIP Clients themselves.
      </para>
      <para>Most of the proxy and media gateways installed by VoIP providers 
      recognize the public IP address the packets have originated from. When both SIP end points are behind a NAT, they can act as
      gateways to clients behind NAT.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>TURN</title>
      <para>TURN (Traversal Using Relay NAT) is an IETF standard, which
      implements media relays for SIP end-points. The standard overcomes the problems of
      clients behind symmetric NATs which cannot rely on STUN to solve NAT
      traversal.</para>
      <para>TURN connects clients behind a NAT to a single peer, providing the same protection offered by symmetric NATs and
      firewalls. The TURN server acts as a relay; any data received is
      forwarded. </para>
      <para>This type of implementation is not ideal. It assumes the clients
      have a trust relationship with a TURN server, and a request session
      allocation based on shared credentials. </para>
      <para>This can result in scalability issues,
      and requires changes in the SIP clients. It is also impossible to determine
      when a direct, or TURN, connection is appropriate.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>ICE</title>
      <para>ICE (Interactive Connection Establishment) leverages both
      STUN and TURN to solve the NAT traversal issues.</para>
      <para>It allows devices to
      probe for multiple paths of communication, by attempting to use different
      port numbers and STUN techniques. If ICE support is present in both
      devices, it is quite possible that the devices can initiate and maintain communication
      end-to-end, without any intermediary media relay.</para>
      <para>Additionally, ICE can
      detect cases where direct communication is impossible and automatically initiate fall-back to a media relay. </para>
      <para>ICE is not currently in widespread use in SIP devices, because ICE capability must be embedded within 
      the SIP devices. </para>
      <para>Depending
      on the negotiated connection, a reINVITE may be required during a session, which adds more
      load to the SIP network and more latency to the call.</para>
      <para>If the
      initiating ICE client attempts to call a non-ICE client, then the call
      setup-process will revert to a conventional SIP call requiring NAT
      traversal to be solved by other means.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Other Approaches</title>
	<para>While the above is a good solution to circumvent NAT issues. There might be cases where it is not possible to use those solutions at all.</para>
	<para>Other approaches include using proxy and media that can act as
      gateways, Session Border Controllers, enhanced Firewall with Application
      Layer Gateway (ALG) and Tunnelling.</para>
    <para>
    	Here is more information on <ulink url="http://groups.google.com/group/mobicents-public/browse_thread/thread/5f1d6cbda9e8c302">Session Border Controllers</ulink> and how they can resolve NAT issues when above solutions 
    	are not possible
