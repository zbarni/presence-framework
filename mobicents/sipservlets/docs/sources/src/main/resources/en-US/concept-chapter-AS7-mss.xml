  <title>Getting Started with &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBoss AS7 </title>



<note>
<title> Features not yet available on &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBoss AS7 </title>
<para> * SIP Clustering and Failover  </para>
<para> * SNMP  </para>
<para> * Jopr Monitoring  </para>
</note>

<para>
Some of the features mentioned above will likely be added in the future. As of the time of this writing, they are not available. Even though Jopr monitoring is not available, there is a Command Line Interface (CLI), which will be discussed further down. As the features become available, this guide will be updated to reflect the changes.

Downloading and Starting &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBoss AS7
</title>
<para>
If you have been working with JBoss for some time, you will quickly notice that the JBoss AS7 iteration has gone through a lot of changes. This guide will help you understand how you can quickly get started with JBoss AS7 within the &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; framework.
</para>

<para>

You can go to the link below to download the latest &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBoss AS7: <ulink url=" https://code.google.com/p/sipservlets/wiki/Downloads?tm=2">Download Latest Version of &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBoss AS7 </ulink>
</para> 

<para>
You will need to extract the content of the file into a directory on your local system. The root directory of the &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBoss AS7 that you downloaded will be referred to in this guide as $JBOSS_HOME.  
</para>


<para>
If this is your first time working with &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBoss, you will need to make sure you have Java Run Time or JDK installed on your computer. You will also need to have the environment variables set.  See the links below to  learn how to get JRE or JDK setup on your system. 
</para>

<title> Starting &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBoss AS7 </title>
To start the server do the following:
</formalpara>
<screen>
$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
</screen>

<para>
During the startup process, you will notice that the final part of the log output will be similar to the truncated output below. Notice that the Admin Console interface can be accessed at <ulink url="http://172.0.0.1:9990">http://172.0.0.1:9990</ulink>. This will be explained later. 
</para>
<screen>

started in 22148ms - Started 222 of 306 services (83 services are passive or on-demand)

</screen>
<para>
You will notice that the startup is very fast. The reason for this is that JBoss was rewritten from the ground up for speed with services being started concurrently and non critical services remain passive until first use. This provides better system resource management. With the simple startup above, you will be able to enter the default web interface of the application server by going to this url http://127.0.0.1:8080. The result will show a screenshot similar to the one below.
</para>

</para>

<para>
With the standard startup script, you will not have access to any SIP functionalities. This is because of the modular approach implemented in JBoss AS7. There is a configuration file that needs to be used to activate additional functionalities like SIP and High Availability.
</para>


<para>
In order to start the &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBoss AS7 with SIP functionalities, you need to append the startup script with the SIP configuration file. The configuration files are located in the $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration directory. You can see the content of the directory below
</para>

</para>

<screen>
./standalone.sh -c standalone-sip.xml
</screen>


<formalpara>
<title> You will see a message similar to the one below once the server is successfully started</title>

<para>
The click2call SIP sample application bundled with &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; will become available at this url <ulink url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/click2call">http://127.0.0.1:8080/click2call</ulink>. You can configure multiple SIP softphones to use the sample application. See the section below for how to configure and test the SIP sample application.
</para>

<section>
<title>Testing Click2Call with &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBOSS AS7 </title>

<para>
Once the server is started as stated in the previous section, you can configure multiple instances of any SIP softphone you prefer. In this example, Linphone will be used.
</para>

<screen>
(configuring two instances of Linphone)

start Linphone 
go to the Options menu

On the Network Settings tab, 
	SIP (UDP) port to 5061. (leave the rest as default)
On the Manage SIP Accounts tab, 
	click the add button
	Your SIP identity: = sip:linphone@127.0.0.1:5080
	SIP Proxy address: = sip 127.0.0.1:5080

Leave the rest of the settings as default.
	

Configuring Linphone (on the second shell)

go to the Options menu

On the Network Settings tab, 
	SIP (UDP) port to 5062. (leave the rest as default)
On the Manage SIP Accounts tab, 
	click the add button
	Your SIP identity: = sip:linphone2@127.0.0.1:5080
	SIP Proxy address: = sip 127.0.0.1:5080

Leave the rest of the settings as default.

<title> Command Line Interface for &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; JBoss AS7</title>


<para>
Part of the task of any administrator who has to manage a JBoss server will be to monitor services offered to clients. There is a command line interface bundled with JBoss AS7 which can be accessed by going to the $JBOSS_HOME/bin directory. 

</para>

<para> You need to make sure that the JBoss server is running on your system and listening on port 9999. The section below will work you through steps to familiarize yourself with the CLI. 
</para>

<para>
There are so many features available with the &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBoss AS7 CLI. The example below will concentrate on getting data from the SIP you started using the <filename> ./standalone.sh -c standalone-sip.xml </filename> script. 
</para>


<para>
In the $JBOSS_HOME/bin directory, type

</para>
<screen>
./jboss-cli.sh 
</screen>
<para>
(This will show the message below)
</para>

<screen>
You are disconnected at the moment. 
Type 'connect' to connect to the server or 
'help' for the list of supported commands.
</screen>
<para>
At the [disconnected /] command  prompt, type 
</para>
<screen>
connect
</screen>

<para>
When you see the [standalone@localhost:9999 /] at the prompt, you are successfully connected to the server.
</para>

<note>
<title>Navigating the CLI </title>
<para>Moving around the &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for JBoss AS7 CLI is similar to normal file system with a few exceptions. You can use commands like, (ls, cd, cd..) to navigate around the CLI
</para>

<title> Deleting Administration Console User Account</title>
<para>
Deleting the user account isn't very intuitive. In the event that you will need to remove an account and create another one, you can remove the account from the mgmt-users.properties file. It is located in the $&SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME;_JBoss_HOME/standalone/configuration directory. If you are running in the domain mode, you will need to check the corresponding configuration directory.
