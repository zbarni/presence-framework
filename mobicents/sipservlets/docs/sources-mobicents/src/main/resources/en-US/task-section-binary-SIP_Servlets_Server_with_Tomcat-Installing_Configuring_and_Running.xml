<para>
The content of the downloaded file can be extracted to any location you prefer on your computer. The root directory to which the content of the download is extracted will be referred to as $CATALINA_HOME. 
</para>

<para>
The content of the $CATALINA_HOME/bin is similar to the output below.

In order to use the application, you can download a softphone and start multiple instances of the phone on a single server. In this guide, the softphone that will be used is Linphone. The configuration is as follows:

<para>
On some Linux systems, you might need to use a different user profile in order to start a second instance of Linphone. Ex. sudo linphone
</para>
</note>

<screen>
(configuring two instances of Linphone)

start Linphone 
go to the Options menu

On the Network Settings tab, 
        SIP (UDP) port to 5061. (leave the rest as default)
On the Manage SIP Accounts tab, 
        click the add button
        Your SIP identity: = sip:linphone@127.0.0.1:5080
        SIP Proxy address: = sip 127.0.0.1:5080

Leave the rest of the settings as default.
        

Configuring Linphone (on the second shell)

go to the Options menu

On the Network Settings tab, 
        SIP (UDP) port to 5062. (leave the rest as default)
On the Manage SIP Accounts tab, 
        click the add button

Once the softphones are configured and are successfully registered with the &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for Tomcat 7 server, you will see a screenshot like the one below in the web browser at this url <ulink url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/Click2CallAsync/">http://127.0.0.1:8080/Click2CallAsync/</ulink>

<para>
You can make calls using the application and the softphones you configured will start ringing. It is important to start &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for Tomcat 7 in a terminal using the (./catalina.sh run) script. It will help with troubleshooting SIP calls. The logs you see on the terminal will let you know when a softphone registers with the Tomcat server and you will also be able to see the status of call setup and shutdown.

<title>Stopping &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for Tomcat 7 </title>
</formalpara>
<para>
The best way to stop a server is using the CTRL-D on the terminal in which the server was started. If you started the &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for Tomcat 7 server using the $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh, you can stop the server using $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh

        <para>For this example, we&apos;ll assume you&apos;re currently in your home directory, which is where you downloaded the zip file to. First, create a subdirectory to hold the unzipped &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for Tomcat files.

      <title>Installing the &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for Tomcat 7 Binary Distribution on Windows</title>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>For this example, we&apos;ll assume that you downloaded the binary distribution zip file to the <filename>My Downloads</filename> folder. First, using Windows Explorer, create a subdirectory in <filename>My Downloads</filename> to extract the zip file&apos;s contents into. When you name this folder, it is good practice to include the version number; if you do so, remember to correctly match it with the version of the &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for Tomcat binary distribution you downloaded. In these instructions, we will refer to this folder as <filename>&CMD_PLATFORM_NAME;-tomcat-<replaceable>&lt;version&gt;</replaceable></filename>.</para>

        <para>Double-click the downloaded zip file, selecting as the destination folder the one you just created to hold the zip file&apos;s contents.</para>
        <stepalternatives>
          <step>
            <para>Alternatively, it is also possible to use Java&apos;s <command>jar <option>-xvf</option></command> command to extract the binary distribution files from the zip archive. To use this method instead, first move the downloaded zip file from <filename>My Downloads</filename> to the folder that you just created to hold the SIP Servlets Server files.</para>
          </step>
          <step>
            <para>Then, open the Windows Command Prompt and navigate to the folder holding the archive using the <command>cd</command> command.</para>

Hold down the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key and right-click on either a folder, the desktop, or inside a folder. This will cause an <guimenuitem>Open Command Window Here</guimenuitem> context menu item to appear, which can be used to open the Command Prompt with the current working directory set to either the folder you opened, or opened it from.</para>
            </note>
          </step>
          <step>

This step is not strictly necessary, but it is probably a good idea to move the installation folder from <filename>My Downloads</filename> to a user-defined location for storing runnable programs. Any location will suffice, however.</para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>You may want to delete the zip file after extracting its contents in order to free disk space:</para>

        <para>The <envar>CATALINA_HOME</envar> environment variable must point to the location of your Tomcat installation. Any &PLATFORM_NAME; server which runs on top of the Tomcat servlet container has a topmost directory, i.e. the directory in which you unzipped the zip file to install the server, and underneath that directory, a <filename>bin</filename> directory. <envar>CATALINA_HOME</envar> must be set to the topmost directory of your &PLATFORM_NAME; server installation.</para>
        <para>If you are planning on running the Tomcat container as the Administrator, then you should, of course, set the <envar>CATALINA_HOME</envar> environment variable <emphasis>as the administrator</emphasis>, and if you planning to run Tomcat as a normal user, then set <envar>CATALINA_HOME</envar> as a user environment variable.</para>

    <para>Configuring &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for Tomcat consists in setting the <envar>CATALINA_HOME</envar> environment variable and then, optionally, customizing your &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for Tomcat container by adding SIP Connectors, configuring the application router, and configuring logging. See <xref linkend="bsssc-binary-SIP_Servlets_Server-Configuring"/> to learn what and how to configure &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for Tomcat.</para>
    <para>Alternatively, you can simply run your &SHORT_PLATFORM_NAME; for Tomcat container now and return to this section to configure it later.</para>

    <title>Running</title>
    <para>Once installed, you can run the Tomcat Servlet Container by executing the one of the startup scripts in the <filename>bin</filename> directory (on Linux or Windows), or by double-clicking the <filename>run.bat</filename> executable batch file in that same directory (on Windows only). However, we suggest always starting Tomcat using the terminal or Command Prompt because you are then able to read—and act upon—any startup messages, and possibly debug any problems that may arise. In the Linux terminal or Command Prompt, you will be able to tell that the container started successfully if the last line of output is similar to the following:</para>
